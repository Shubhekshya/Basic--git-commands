repository(repo) - the space in github that contains all relted files of a project.
clone - use to bring files from remote repo to your local repo (laptop).
 >>>>  git clone <link from github>

changes are first made in the vs, after that ,those changes must be reflected in the remote repo 
for that we use add, commit, push commands.

Firstly, let's learn about varoius stages of changed files.
1.untracked - those files that are created only in vs code but remote rerpo is unaware.
2.modified - those files that are from remote repo and changes are made only in vs
3.umoidfied - those files that are in remote repo and vs as it is.
4.staged - those files that are mofidfied in vs and added to remote repo and remained to commit.
             to check status of files cmmd is
             >>>>       git status



so here is the work flow
        create remote repo
                |
         CLONE to local 
                |
           CHANGES
                |
          ADD TO THE Remote 
                |
              COMMIT 
                |
              PUSH  


lets add a new branch "Part1" for further commmands.\
 for that command is
    >>>>   git checkout -d <new branch>
