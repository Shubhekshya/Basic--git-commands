now sometimes we have to merge branches.
if the diffenent braches have chnges maed at differnt line of code, 
there will be simple technique to merge those branch
BUT  if the changes are made in sme place in both branch thre occurs "MERGE CONFLICT"

to find what is the diiference between braches (compare commit, flies,etc)
>>>  git diff <branch_name>

to merge we have two ways
    1.through terminal
>>>> git merge <branch_name>

    2.  throgh github PULL REQUEST
