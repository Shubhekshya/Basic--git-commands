As the project progresses, there can be various portion in it where multiple personals work on.
suppose there were was this sequence of work
             login --> signup -->button -->arrow
but someone wnated to go diffrent path from signup i.e
             login --> signup -->button -->arrow
                              |                 ------->a webform
                              -->dropdown --> box
so here if 1st was the mian plan but some wnet and wnated to follow differnt starting from same origin 
can create a branch for that 

 to create branch
 >>>>   git checkout -b <new branch> 

to switch between branches
>>>>  git checkout <desired_branch>

to delete the branch
>>>> git branch -d <desired_branch>

to add,commit cmmd is similar as in main 
but to  push there will be slight difference in naming 
 i.e >>>  git push origin <branch_name>
